/**
	 * Site is a class that is used to store information about your site in
	 * a nice and simple location.The Site class contains 3 pieces of information
	 * about your web site, used mainly for input into the Session object.  These
	 * include the domain name of your site, which must contain at least 2 periods (.)
	 * in order to function properly; the web path from the document root of the
	 * site, and a 1 or 0 denoting whether or not we're running behind a Secure
	 * Socket Layer (SSL).
	 * 
	 * The nice part about Site though is that you can store any other properties
	 * you want to in it on the fly, because PHP allows you to do so without
	 * extending the class.  This makes Site a nice place to store information
	 * you want to maintain throughout your application.
	 * 
	 * New in 1.2:
	 * - Added a prefix() method.
	 * 
	 * New in 1.4:
	 * - Moved the prefix() method to saf.Site.SitelliteSite instead, since it uses
	 *   the Sitellite-specific SITELLITE_LEVEL constant.
	 * 
	 * New in 2.0:
	 * - All new property names, including $webpath, $adminpath, $docroot, and $appdir.
	 *   These changes are necessary in order to support sites with code outside of the
	 *   document root.  Note: The old $wwwpath is now an alias to $webpath, $abspath
	 *   is an alias to $docroot, and $path is an alias to $adminpath.  Also, the
	 *   constructor's parameters have changed.
	 * 
	 * New in 2.2:
	 * - Moved SitelliteSite::prefix() to this class and made it a property (the method
	 *   exists for b/c), so as to consolidate the two packages.  SitelliteSite::runmode
	 *   is also not used any more by SCS, so that "went West" as they say.
	 * - Added $current property, and site_current ().
	 * 
	 * <code>
	 * <?php
	 * 
	 * // create a Site object that sits behind SSL
	 * $site = new SitelliteSite (array (
	 * 	"domain"    => "www.yoursite.com",
	 * 	"docroot"   => "/home/yoursite/public_html",
	 * 	"appdir"    => "/home/yoursite/public_html",
	 * 	"webpath"   => "/",
	 * 	"adminpath" => "/sitellite",
	 * 	"secure"    => 1,
