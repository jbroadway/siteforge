    *   about 1000-5000 elements since the entire tree is read at once from the data source.
    *   use this to instanciate a class of a tree if you i.e.
    *   -   need the entire tree at once
    *   -   want to work on the tree w/o db-access for every call
    *   since this set of classes loads the entire tree into the memory, you should
    *   be aware about the size of the tree you work on using this class
    *   for one you should know how efficient this kind of tree class is on
    *   your data source (i.e. db) and what effect it has reading the entire tree at once.
    *   on small trees, like upto about 1000 elements an instance of this class
    *   will give you very powerful means to manage/modify the tree, no matter from which
    *   data source it comes, either from a nested-DB, simple-DB, XML-File/String or
    *   whatever is implemented
