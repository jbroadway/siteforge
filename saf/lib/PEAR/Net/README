The NetGeo server is provided by CAIDA (caida.org). If you are concerned with
with anything to do with using the NetGeo server, please check their website
(http://www.caida.org/tools/utilities/netgeo/)

localizer is available from http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/localizer/

Even though the NetGeo server will process domain names I find that success is
sporadic. Using IP addresses or AS numbers will work everytime.
