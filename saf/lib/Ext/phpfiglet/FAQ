1. What is it?

     phpFiglet is a PHP class file that can be called from your own programs
     to display text in an unusual manner.


2. What does it do?

     It creates text that can look like this:

       _ _       _  _        _ _ _            _    _ 
      | | | ___ | || | ___  | | | | ___  _ _ | | _| |
      |   |/ ._>| || |/ . \ | | | |/ . \| '_>| |/ . |
      |_|_|\___.|_||_|\___/ |__/_/ \___/|_|  |_|\___|


3. Why did you make this?

     At the risk of sounding like an old man, back in the old days a lot of 
     people used asci art to create email signatures that looked a bit more 
     interesting than a standard name and adres. Three guys, Frank, Ian and 
     Glen made a program called Figlet that lets someone input some text and 
     printed it like the above example. As far as I know there was no way to 
     do something similar from PHP, so I wrote this class.


4. What can I use it for?

     You name it. Displaying errors, printing messages to users, drawing
     attention. Whatever you can think of.


5. How do I install it?

     Very simple, extract the provided file with tar and gunzip as follows
     into its destination directory. 
     
       tar -xvf phpfiglet.tar.gz
       gunzip phpfiglet.tar
       
     This will create a directory named phpfiglet containing all the files.


6. How do I use it?

     Very simple:

       require("phpfiglet_class.php");
       $phpFiglet = new phpFiglet();
       if ($phpFiglet->loadFont("fonts/standard.flf")) {
          $phpFiglet->display("Hello World");
       } else {
          trigger_error("Could not load font file");
       }


7. Why does my output look all messed up?

     phpFiglet relies on the fact that you display it's generated text in a
     nonproportional font. For webpages this usually means that you have to
     put <pre>tags</pre> around your figletized text. Also some fonts are
     more readable than others and some don't support the entire character
     set.


8. How do I make my own fonts?

     That's actually pretty easy. Go to the original figlet site, download
     there program, and read the file figfont.txt contained in their 
     archive.


9. License, copyright and legalese?

     phpFiglet is released under the GPL, and copyright by Lucas Baltes.
     The original Figlet program is covered by the Artistic License, so
     its terms might apply to phpFiglet too. I'm not a lawyer, go ask one
     if you need to know. The included fonts are copyright by their creators 
     whos names are usually in the first few lines of the font file. See
