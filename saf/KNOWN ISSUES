KNOWN ISSUES

Please see http://www.sitellite.org/ for a current bug tracking list.

- The Sitellite Application Framework (specifically the XML packages) rely on
  a deprecated way of passing references in PHP.  This causes warning if
  allow_call_time_pass_reference is set to Off in php.ini.  Until a better
  way of doing what we need to do is available (ie. in PHP 5.0), we'll
  be doing it this way.

- If you have Apache configured where the document root of the site does not
  match the file path (ie. you're using a symbolic link, or the like), you
  may have problems.  If you experience such problems, please write to the
  list, and we'll see what we can do.
