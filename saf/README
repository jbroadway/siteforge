License

The Sitellite Application Framework (SAF) is licensed separately from the rest of
the Sitellite Content Server (SCS).  While SCS is licensed under the GPL, we
chose the LGPL for SAF because it allows for use by commercial applications
which the GPL does not.  Please read the license in the file saf/LICENSE before

Instructions

To use these libraries, copy the entire saf folder to wherever you want, and
make sure your PHP scripts can access that location.  Then you can use them
by simply including the libraries you need.  We recommend using the provided
init.php script in the saf directory, which creates a $loader (saf.Loader)
object with a preconfigured 'saf' namespace, and also includes some custom
functions that some packages may rely on.  This can be done using the
following code (assumes the SAF installation is in an 'saf' folder directly
below the running script):

<?php

include_once ('saf/init.php');

// you can now use $loader to import additional packages
// or to define additional namespaces.

?>
