Installation

(Note: Upgrading information is below this section)

1. Extract the Sitellite tarball in the base directory of your web site.
   On Unix, execute the following command on the shell:

tar -zxvf sitellite-4.2.0-stable.tar.gz

   This should create a directory called sitellite-4.2.0-stable.  You will
   have to copy all of the files and folders in this directory into the base
   directory of your web site.  If you have a pre-existing site there already,
   which we recommend against installing on top of, please be careful you
   aren't overwriting anything you need.

   To copy these files over from the command line, do the following from in
   the same directory you just extracted the Sitellite tarball in:

cp sitellite-4.2.0-stable/.htaccess .
cp -R sitellite-4.2.0-stable/* .

2. Before you can run the web-based installer, you will need to set the
   Unix file permissions of Sitellite.  To do this, enter the following
   commands:

chmod -R 777 cache
chmod -R 777 inc/app/cms/conf/services
chmod -R 777 inc/app/cms/data
chmod -R 777 inc/conf
chmod -R 777 inc/data
chmod -R 777 inc/html
chmod -R 777 install
chmod -R 777 pix
chmod -R 777 inc/app/*/conf
chmod -R 777 inc/app/*/data
chmod -R 777 inc/app/*/lang
chmod 777 inc/app/*

3. Launch the web-based installer by going to the following web site URL:

http://www.yourWebSite.com/install

   Follow the instructions of the installer, and it will guide you through
   the remainder of the installation process.

4. In order for certain functions in Sitellite to behave correctly,
   Sitellite's task scheduler needs to be run at certain intervals.  Full
   details for the scheduler can be found in Sitellite's bulit-in help
   documents, which you should be able to access once you've completed
   step 3.

5. If you want to install any additional apps (see inc/app), please refer
   to their install instructions.
