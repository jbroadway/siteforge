ABOUT

SiteStreamer lets you create podcasts and m3u playlists in Sitellite.
Podcasts are audio or video broadcasts sent out in the form of RSS feeds.
Playlists are the format used by music software such as Winamp or iTunes to
play a series of files in a row.

CREDITS

SiteStreamer uses the osflv.com Flash video player for playing .flv files.

INSTALLATION

To install SiteStreamer, simply unzip it to a folder named inc/app/sitestreamer
in your Sitellite installation.  There is no additional setup required, as
SiteStreamer is just a wrapper around the Web Files content collection in
Sitellite.

The commands on Unix systems to unzip the file would be:

# Unzip the file
tar -zxf sitestreamer-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz

# Rename the resulting folder
mv sitestreamer-1.0.0-stable sitestreamer

# Delete the downloaded file
rm sitestreamer-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz

USAGE

To create a podcast or playlist, log into Sitellite and go to the Control
Panel.  From there, under the Content menu choose "Web Files", then click the
"Add File" link on the next screen.

Click "Browse..." and upload the audio or video file that contains your first
podcast show.  Next, click "Add" next to the Folder field and create a new
folder for your podcast files.  Make sure to select the new folder after
creating it; it will appear in the select box once it's been created.

To ensure that visitors will be able to access the files, click on the "State"
tab and set the status to "Approved".  Click "Create" at the bottom of the
form and repeat for any additional files you wish to add to your podcast or
playlist.  This is also how you will add new shows to your podcast later on.

The next step is to link your podcast or playlist into your website.  The
easiest way to do this is to use the Xed 2 box chooser.  After installing
SiteStreamer, Sitellite Pro users will see a new "SiteStreamer" option in
that dialogue window.  Simply select "SiteStreamer" from the list, then
either "Podcast" or "Playlist", then fill out any information requested, such
as the title and folder of the podcast or playlist.  This will create a link
to the podcast or playlist where the box was inserted into the page.

For users of Sitellite GPL Edition, there are 3 ways to call SiteStreamer
without Xed 2's box chooser.  These are:

1. Linking directly to the podcast or playlist URLs

The link format to link directly to a podcast is:

http://www.example.com/index/sitestreamer-podcast-action/path.foldername/title.Podcast Name

2. Making a sidebar box an alias of the sitestreamer/podcast box

To do this, create a new sidebar and under the "Properties" tab enter the
following value into the "Alias" field:

sitestreamer/podcast?title=Podcast Name&path=foldername

3. Linking to the podcast or playlist boxes in an XT template

The format of the XT box inclusion would look like this:

<xt:box name="sitestreamer/podcast" title="Podcast Name" path="foldername" />

That should be all you have to do to get up and running with a new podcast
or audio stream for your website.

DEVELOPERS

For developers, you can also use the loader_box() function or the {box} tag
in .spt files to include SiteStreamer capabilities into your custom web
applications.  For example:

<?php

echo loader_box (
	'sitestreamer/podcast',
	array (
		'title' => 'Podcast Name',
		'path' => 'foldername',
	)
);

?>

And in an .spt file:

{box sitestreamer/podcast?title=Podcast Name&path=foldername}
