If there is more than one author,;   separate their names with a comma and a space.  The parameters value;   is a list of parameters that this box may accept.  Otherwise, go nuts.;   These four options must fall under the [Meta] section.  We recommended;   that you put box-specific options under a different section, such as;   [Custom].;[Meta]name			= Navigation - Treeversion			= 1.0path			= inc/boxes/sitellite/nav/treedescription		= Shows the entire navigation tree.author			= John Luxford <lux@simian.ca>parameters		= none;; THE END;; DO NOT ALTER THIS LINE, IT IS HERE FOR SECURITY REASONS */ ?>
