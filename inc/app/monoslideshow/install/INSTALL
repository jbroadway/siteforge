Installing the Monoslideshow app
--------------------------------

Please Note: The Monoslideshow app requires the PHP GD extension with JPEG
support for use in generating thumbnails of images.

1. Unpack the app into inc/app

cp monoslideshow_app.tar.gz /path/to/sitellite/inc/app
cd /path/to/sitellite/inc/app
tar -zxf monoslideshow_app.tar.gz

2. Set the permissions of the pix folder to 777

chmod -R 777 monoslideshow/pix

3. Place the monoslideshow.swf file from your copy of Monoslideshow into
the monoslideshow/html folder.

4. Embed into any page with the box chooser or with the XT command:

<xt:box name="monoslideshow/embed" folder="some_folder_inside_pix" />

Make sure that "some_folder_inside_pix" is replaced with a real sub-folder
of pix/ that contains .jpg images.
