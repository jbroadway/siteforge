<h1>About AppDoc</h1>

AppDoc is Sitellite's built-in documentation utility.&nbsp; AppDoc
provides a detailed introspection of any installed Sitellite app,
including access settings and box/form usage examples.&nbsp; AppDoc
integrates with PHPDocumentor (pre-installed) to generate API
documentation as well, and for developing end-user documentation AppDoc
features a built-in WYSIWYG multi-lingual user manual editor.<br />
<br />
AppDoc takes PHP development to the next level by providing better
transparency in your code, and by taking care of the nitty gritty
details most platforms neglect to address, such as end user
manuals.&nbsp; Help is an integral part of the Sitellite development
model.<br />
<br />
In addition to documentation, AppDoc provides translation features,
which allow you to translate your Sitellite-based applications into
multiple languages.&nbsp; This is accessible from the "Languages" link
on each app's detail screen.<br />
