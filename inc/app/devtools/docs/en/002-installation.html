<h1>Installation</h1>

You should decompress (unzip) your devtools download into the inc/app
folder of your Sitellite installation.&nbsp; The only additional setup
required is to add the devtools/bin folder to your execution path.&nbsp;
On Unix, you would do the following:<br />
<br />
<pre>$ export PATH=$PATH:/PATH/TO/SITELLITE/inc/app/devtools/bin</pre>
<br />
So that you don't have to repeat this every time you want to use
devtools, it is a good idea to include it in your shell initialization
script, usually ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc on popular Unix systems.<br />
<br />
This will allow you to execute the devtools commands without having to
specify the full path to the command script each time you want to run
one of them.<br />
