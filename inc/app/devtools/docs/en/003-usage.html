<h1>Usage</h1>

The scripts provided by devtools live in the inc/app/devtools/bin
directory, which is inaccessible from the browser window via an
.htaccess file.&nbsp; These scripts can be called from the
command-line, or by other programs (including Sitellite apps) through
system calls.<br />
<br />
Executing the tools themselves will return usage information about each tool.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
<pre>$ app.sh<br />Usage: app.sh APPNAME</pre>
<br />
This tells you that app.sh requires an app name in order to
run.&nbsp; Running it again, this time giving it an app name, will
yield the following result instead:<br />
<br />
<pre>$ app.sh myapp<br />Your app is ready, sir.</pre>
<br />
It will also have created your new app structure in the current working directory, which you can explore via these commands:<br />
<br />
<pre>$ ls<br />myapp<br />$ ls myapp/<br />boxes&nbsp; conf&nbsp; data&nbsp; docs&nbsp; forms&nbsp; html&nbsp; install&nbsp; lib&nbsp; pix</pre>
<br />
