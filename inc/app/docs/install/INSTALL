ABOUT

This app implements a documentation browser for the Sitellite class libraries
in the saf/lib directory of Sitellite.  It's very simple (one class basically)
based on the PHP tokenizer and one simple output template.

The motivation was that PhpDocumentor began running out of memory for me, with
up to 256MB allotted to it, and even with just the default settings.  Doxygen
then didn't seem to like the PhpDocumentor-isms in my code, and although
PHPDoctor was much better (and fast!) it seemed to get confused with too many
@package tags and put most things into the default package, so I wrote my own.

I would like to extend it to also work with any Sitellite app's libraries as
well, which should be really easy to do.

INSTALLATION

To install, unzip into inc/app/docs and chmod 777 inc/app/docs/data which
enables caching for progressively better performance.

To access, go to /index/docs-app on your site.

TODO

- Stop hard-coding it for saf/lib and allow it to build references for classes
  in inc/app/*/lib as well (just look at all the code in the cms app's lib!)

- Implement a filemtime check on the cache vs real files, not a huge priority
  since code for a released version of software should in theory never change
  (that would be a new release).

- Any suggestions?
