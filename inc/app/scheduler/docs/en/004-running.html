<h1>Running Scheduler</h1>

Scheduler is a command-line tool, so you don't use a browser to access
it.&nbsp; On just about any Unix shell, you can manually call Scheduler
with the following command (note: this command is executed from the
base directory of your Sitellite installation):<br />
<br />
bash$ php -f index scheduler-app<br />
<br />Here is an example of running this command hourly in cron.&nbsp; On the command-line, type:<br />
<br />
bash$ crontab -e<br />
<br />
Then enter the following info into the cron editor (this is usually the VI editor).<br />
<br />
# MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMAND<br />
# once an hour<br />
0 * * * * cd /path/to/sitellite; php -f index scheduler-app<br />
<br />
For more informatino about scheduling tasks on your system, please
consult your server operating system documentation.&nbsp; For cron, you
can access this from the command-line by typing:<br />
<br />
bash$ man cron<br />
