<h1>The Error Log</h1>

Because Scheduler is supposed to be called repeatedly at various
intervals (ie. nightly, hourly, etc.) via your server's scheduling
utility (cron, the Windows Task Scheduler), and not by an actual
administrative user, it is intended to produce no output to the
screen.&nbsp; So the rule is, no response is a good response, when it
comes to Scheduler.&nbsp; A response on the screen means a task is not
functioning correctly.<br />

In fact, only warnings and error messages are shown on the screen,
which usually causes the system's scheduling utility to email the
server's administrator so you can fix the problem.<br />

Any deliberate output produced by a task (ie. echo "all done!";) isn't
printed to the screen like you'd expect, but rather it is appended to a
log file that lives in the inc/app/scheduler/log folder called
scheduler.log.&nbsp; The format of a log message is as follows:<br />
