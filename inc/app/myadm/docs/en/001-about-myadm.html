<h1>About Database Manager</h1>

<p>The database manager is a direct access layer to the underlying MySQL database under Sitellite.  It comes pre-installed, and is very handy for power users and developers in making quick and dirty low-level edits.</p>

<p>Probably the handiest part of Database Manager is the SQL Shell, which allows you to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, which is great for testing out new code and ideas.</p>
