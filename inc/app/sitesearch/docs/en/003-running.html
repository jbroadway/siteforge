<h1>Running the SiteSearch Indexer</h1>

<p>Before you can run the SiteSearch indexer, you need to add it as a
task to Scheduler app's task list.&nbsp; To do this, copy the task from
the SiteSearch install folder into the proper place, like this:<br />
</p>
<pre>$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE<br />$ cp -R inc/app/sitesearch/install/sitesearch inc/app/scheduler/tasks/<br /></pre>
<p>The SiteSearch indexer will then be run as part of the Scheduler's
task list.&nbsp; To execute it separately, you can use the following
commands:<br />
</p>


<pre>$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ php -f index scheduler-app sitesearch</pre>

<p>This will automatically index all of the collections defined in your web
site that specify a "sitesearch_url" property in their definition files
(see inc/app/cms/conf/collections for examples).<br />
