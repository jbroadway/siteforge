<h1>Searching File Contents</h1>

SiteSearch will automatically index the "Web Files" collection within

Sitellite, and make it available for searching.&nbsp; Only files marked

with an access level of "public" will appear on the public web site

however (or "member" for member-level users, etc.).<br />

<br />

To search files more effectively, SiteSearch will index the contents of

known file types in addition to their descriptions and keywords.&nbsp;

The known file types that come with SiteSearch are as follows

(including their typical file extensions and mime types):<br />

<ul>

  <li>Text files (.txt, text/plain)<br />

  </li>

  <li>HTML files (.html, text/html)</li>

  <li>XML files (.xml, text/xml)<br />

  </li>

  <li>Microsoft Word (.doc, application/ms-word)</li>

  <li>Microsoft Excel (.xls, application/vnd.ms-excel)</li>

  <li>Microsoft Powerpoint (.ppt, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint)<br />

  </li>

  <li>vCard files (.vcf, text/x-vcard)</li>

  <li>iCal files (.ical, text/calendar)</li>

  <li>RTF files (.rtf, text/rtf)</li>

  <li>PDF files (.pdf, application/pdf)</li>

  <li>MP3 files (.mp3, audio/mpeg)</li>

  <li>Photoshop files (.psd, image/x-photoshop)</li>

</ul>

Additional file types can be added to the folder

inc/app/sitesearch/lib/Extractors -- and of course, we welcome new

file type contributions!<br />
