<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

The following is a list of common problems and possible solutions.<br />

<br />

<h2>1. I'm getting duplicates in my search results.</h2>

Try deleting the contents of the folder inc/app/sitesearch/data and

re-index the site. This is usually the result of old test data

lingering that doesn't have an expiry date in it.<br />

<br />

<h2>2. I get HTML output when I run the indexer.</h2>

You likely don't have the PHP command line interface (CLI)

installed. You can check by doing a "php -v" on the command line

and it will likely say CGI instead of CLI. You will need to

recompile PHP with the configure option --enable-cli specified.<br />
