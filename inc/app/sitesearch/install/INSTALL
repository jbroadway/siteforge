SITESEARCH INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Please note that SiteSearch requires PHP version 5.1 or greater to run.

1. Install the necessary database tables:

$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME < inc/app/sitesearch/install/install-mysql.sql
(enter password when prompted)

2. Copy the indexer into the Scheduler app:

$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ cp -R inc/app/sitesearch/install/sitesearch inc/app/scheduler/tasks/

3. Run the indexer for the first time.  Warning: Don't do this during
rush-hour traffic on your web site!  If you have a big site, this could
take some time and/or slow your site down while it's happening.

$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ php -f index scheduler-app sitesearch

Subsequent indexes will run when the Scheduler runs (ie. whenever you
told it to in your crontab).

4. In the Sitellite Control Panel, choose Admin > Workflow Services.
Check off all three services under the SiteSearch section and click
"Save".  This enables Sitellite to automatically add and manage records
in the SiteSearch index when documents are created and modified within
Sitellite, keeping the index in sync with the site at all times.

5. Link to SiteSearch somewhere on your web site.  SiteSearch can be
accessed from the following URL (change www.yourWebSite.com to YOUR
WEB SITE, of course):

http://www.yourWebSite.com/index/sitesearch-app

That's all there is to it!
