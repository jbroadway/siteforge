  types to the system.

Changes in 1.2.0

- Fixed Java path in java/compile.sh
- Fixed permissions on java/restart.sh
- Fixed a bug causing the deletion of records from the index not to be
  reflected in the search results until the SiteSearch daemon was restarted.
- Added workflow services to automatically add, update, and delete records
  from the SiteSearch index when documents are added or modified in
  Sitellite.  This keeps the SiteSearch index 100% in sync with the
  live web site at all times.

Changes in 1.0.0

- Added support for the OpenSearch RSS extension.

Changes in 0.9.6-rc

- Patched Conf.java to allow SiteSearch to work with Java 1.3, since
  String.split() is new to 1.4 -- thanks to Oliver for the patch!
- Fixed an invalid object request in the IXR code that caused blank
  pages when the server is stopped.
- Updated several of the PEAR packages used, including Net/Socket,
  Net/URL, and HTTP/Request.

Changes in 0.9.5-rc

- Moved importing filters to a global location.  This was causing the
  descriptions to disappear.
- Added script, running.sh, that can be called by cron to check the status
  of the SiteSearch daemon, and auto-restart it if necessary.
- Fixed missing methods in the new IXR 2.0 package.
- Fixed a bug causing the pager to break the search results.
- Added the following characters to the escape list: +-^~.

Changes in 0.9.4-rc

- Upgraded the XML-RPC client to the new "Unofficial" IXR 2.0 from
  phppatterns.com, which solved an error I was occasionally getting
  on my development copy (although I'd never seen in on the live sites,
  but better safe than sorry).
- Added a new domains field to the server, allowing you to potentially
  hook up multiple Sitellite sites to the same server by using the same
  settings for each of them.
- Added domain and content type to the logger, and added both of them
  also to the admin stats UI.
- Added a syntax field in the search result metadata, so that you can
  inspect the actual query used by the server.
- Added the syntax to the search accessor in the admin UI.
- Server now properly handles special characters: ![](){}:

Changes in 0.9.3-rc

- Fixed a "division by zero" error when viewing the stats page after the
  indexer has been run, but before any searches have been performed.
- Added a built-in mime type list, so that you're not dependent on the
  new mime_content_type() function, or the workaround to it using
  `file -bi $filename`, which is flaky.
- Added link for administrators to view the results of a given search from
  the stats page, without it altering the stats by performing the search.

Changes in 0.9.2-rc

- Added content extractor for files.  Handles the following types out of the
  box: Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF, vCard, iCal, RTF, HTML, XML, MP3, and
  Photoshop (PSD) files.
- Added bold-ing of search terms in search results.
- Added new documentation:
  - A note to explain how to make highlighting display (CSS for
    span.highlighted)
  - An explanation of the extractor.
  - An overview of the XML-RPC API.
  - FAQ for common problems.
- Improved the security of the server by requiring the keyCode in all
  proper places.
- Added a new script, restart.sh, for restarting the server.
- Added total and average at the bottom of the "Total Searches" stats.
- Changed date formats to display full month names instead of abbreviations.
- Added checking for a sitesearch_access setting in collection config files,
  allowing collections to be restricted from public access.
- Added RSS syndication of search results.  This, plus news/rss/viewer,
  or some custom code based on news/rss/viewer, could make for a powerful
  "Related Forum Posts" or "Related News Stories" feature, or just a new
  way of syndicating your web site content.
- Added checking for a sitesearch_highlight setting in collection config
  files, allowing collections to determine whether they provide highlighting
  support or not.  Default is that they DO.
- Added ctype to the search result property list.
