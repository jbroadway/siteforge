SHOUTBOX INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install the necessary database tables:

$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME < inc/app/shoutbox/install/install-mysql.sql
(enter password when prompted)

2. Include the Shoutbox somewhere on your web site.  There are three ways of
doing this:

a) Create a new sidebar, click the Properties tab and enter "shoutbox/display"
under the Alias field.

b) Link to the following URL (change www.yourWebSite.com to YOUR WEB SITE,
of course):

http://www.yourWebSite.com/index/shoutbox-app

c) For Sitellite Professional users, create a new sidebar or web page and
click the Box Chooser in Xed.  Select "Shoutbox" then "Display Shoutbox".
Save your page or sidebar and you will see the Shoutbox in it.

That's all there is to it!
