<h1>Xed 2.0 Vision</h1>

<p>Xed version 1.0 is already a very simple yet featureful <span class="caps">HTML</span> editing widget for the Sitellite <span class="caps">CMS</span>.  It boasts features such as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cross-browser/cross-platform support</li>
	<li>Complete editing functionality, including basic table creation</li>
	<li>Adding images from server or local hard-drive (via Image Chooser app)</li>
	<li>Implemented as a MailForm widget, so that it can be integrated into Sitellite apps as easily as possible</li>
</ol>

<p>But we want to go further than that in the next version.  We want to be the best browser-based <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editor out there.  And for this we need a new set of goals.  So far, these include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Keep the UI and the number of features at a minimum</li>
	<li>Improved table editing (add/remove columns and rows, headers, table properties, etc.)</li>
	<li>Spell checker app (w/ custom dictionaries)</li>
	<li>Multiple instances per <span class="caps">HTML</span> page</li>
	<li><span class="caps">XML</span> editing (using schemas to build the toolbar, but no <span class="caps">XSLT </span>&#8212;<span class="caps">CSS</span> can do the same job more easily)</li>
	<li>Box-maker and form-maker apps to be able to choose, configure, and insert boxes and forms dynamically into any page (using <code>&lt;xt-box name="..." /&gt;</code> syntax and some basic <span class="caps">CSS</span>)</li>
	<li>Improved I18n support (translated UI, <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 support)</li>
	<li>Full-screen editing mode</li>
	<li>Content templates for improving consistency of content throughout sites</li>
</ol>
