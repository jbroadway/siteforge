<h1>Using Xed</h1>

<p>To create a Xed widget in one of your forms, simply add the following elements to your form settings.php file:</p>

<pre><code>
[field_name]
type = xed.Widget.Xeditor
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the necessary widget.  Now in the main [Form] section, add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>
extra = "onsubmit=`xed_copy_value (this, 'field_name')`"
</code></pre>

<p>This handles the task of copying the editor value from the iframe to a hidden variable within the form (created automatically for you) that will pass along the editor contents upon form submission.</p>

<p>You can also call the Xed MailForm widget directly from <span class="caps">PHP</span> code, if your form doesn&#8217;t happen to use a settings.php file for some reason.  In this case you could simply say all at once:</p>

<pre><code>
$widget =&#38; $form-&gt;addWidget ('xed.Widget.Xeditor', 'field_name');
$form-&gt;extra = 'onsubmit="xed_copy_value (this, \'field_name\')"';
</code></pre>
