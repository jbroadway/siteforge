<h1>Browser Requirements</h1>

<p>Xed is a cross-platform in-browser <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editor, but that doesn&#8217;t mean every browser is made equally now.  Xed officially supports the following browsers on the specified platforms:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or greater on Windows only.  <span class="caps">MSIE</span> on Mac is a very different product than its Windows counterpart, and as such doesn&#8217;t support the contentEditable <span class="caps">API</span> at all.</li>
	<li>Mozilla 1.3 or greater on any operating system.  Tested OSes include Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span>, Linux, and FreeBSD.</li>
</ol>
