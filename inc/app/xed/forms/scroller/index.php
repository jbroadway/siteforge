(Reuters) - Democratic White House hopeful Howard Dean on Sunday\ncalled on his front-running rival John Kerry to apologize to the\nAmerican people for hypocrisy by pretending to be free of special\ninterest money. </p>\n<p>Dean, whose high-flying presidential bid crashed in Iowa\nand New Hampshire last month when he finished far behind Kerry, has\ntried to reinvigorate his campaign by confronting the senator head on\nover his ties to big money and lobbyists. </p>\n<p>\"This is a war of principles, not a war of words,\" Dean\ntold reporters on his campaign plane. \"He misrepresented himself,\ngrossly misrepresented himself, as a candidate who would take on\nspecial interests in Washington. That is factually untrue.\" </p>\n<p>Dean cited a nonpartisan study showing Kerry had taken\nmore money from special interests than any other U.S. senator in the\npast 15 years. </p>\n<p>\"I call on Sen. Kerry to apologize to the American people\nfor misleading them during the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire\nprimary and for saying that he was going to stand up to the special\ninterests,\" Dean said. </p>\n<p>The former Vermont governor also raised a Newsweek report\non Sunday that Kerry met and corresponded with Johnny Chung, a key\nfigure in the 1996 fund-raising scandals, in the summer of 1996 before\nChung threw a September fund-raiser for Kerry. Kerry had previously\nclaimed his first meeting with Chung was at the fund-raiser. </p>\n<p>\"If he had never been out there saying I don't take money\nfrom special interests ... I wouldn't be doing this right now,\" Dean\nsaid. \"I'm just incensed by his hypocrisy.\" </p>\n<p>Dean said the senator was being disingenuous.\n\n				</p>\n<p>\"I\nthink he's playing within the system,\" Dean said. \"I think he's guilty\nof saying one thing and doing another. And when you're pretending to be\nfree of influence ...I mean, there are numerous, documented instances\nwhen contributions came in and favorable action was taken.\" </p>\n<p>Once the front-runner with the money and the momentum,\nDean said he had bet $40 million on wrapping up the nomination early --\nand lost. He also acknowledged that he might not win any of the seven\nstates that hold contests on Tuesday. </p>\n\"How the mighty have fallen,\" he quipped on NBC's \"Meet\nthe Press.\" \"We spent a lot of money in Iowa and New Hampshire trying\nto win. We took an enormous gamble and it didn't work.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a class=\"storyOptionsText\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&amp;storyID=4257470&amp;pageNumber=1\">Continued ...</a></b>\n	\n\n\n\n\nAfter raising a more $40 million, mostly through small donations over\nthe Internet, the Dean campaign is struggling to pay its bills and has\nasked staff to defer their paychecks for two weeks. Other staff are\nbeing moved or let go to reduce operating costs. \n<p>Dean has said only that the campaign is \"not broke\" and that\nhe does not want to operate on a deficit. Some estimates have put his\nwar chest at as little as $3 million or less. </p>\n<p>Losses in the first two contest of the 2004 election\nseason forced Dean to change strategy. Now he hopes to hang in the\nrace, picking up enough delegates to be the last man standing as an\nalternative to Kerry after Wisconsin votes on Feb. 17. </p>\n<p>Dean was looking past South Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona,\nDelaware, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Missouri, which hold contests on\nTuesday, to Michigan and Washington State on Feb. 7 and Wisconsin 10\ndays later. </p>\n\"We probably won't win someplace by Feb. 3, with the  possible exception of New Mexico,\" he said on Sunday.\n";
