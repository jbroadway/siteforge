<h1>About DevNotes</h1>

<p>DevNotes is an app that allows you to attach comments to any web page of your site.  This is very handy for sharing information on private or semi-private project sites, by centralizing communication and information gathering.</p>

<p>The original purpose of DevNotes was to improve the feedback process for our custom development contracts, where DevNotes are attached to each page of the project outline, use-case scenarios, screenshots, as well as software prototypes.  This helps eliminate the communication problems associated with email.</p>
