SITEINVOICE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install the necessary database tables:

$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME < inc/app/siteinvoice/install/install-mysql.sql
(enter password when prompted)

2. Set the siteinvoice/data folder and the siteinvoice/conf folder to be
writeable:

$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ chmod -R 777 inc/app/siteinvoice/data
$ chmod -R 777 inc/app/siteinvoice/conf

3. Copy the siteinvoice scheduled task to the scheduler's task folder:

$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ cp -R inc/app/siteinvoice/install/siteinvoice inc/app/scheduler/tasks/

4. Add a crontab entry to run the siteinvoice scheduler task nightly.
This crontab entry should look something like the following:

0 8 * * * cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE; php -f index scheduler-app siteinvoice

The above example will run the siteinvoice task at 8 AM each morning.  The
task doesn't need to be run more than once a day.

5. Modify the siteinvoice/pix/header.jpg graphic to include your company
name or logo instead of the default.

6. You can use SiteInvoice either from within the Sitellite Control Panel
or by accessing it directly at the following URL (change www.yourWebSite.com
to YOUR WEB SITE, of course):

http://www.yourWebSite.com/index/siteinvoice-app

That's all there is to it!
