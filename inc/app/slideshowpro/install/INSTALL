Installing the SlideshowPro app
-------------------------------

Please Note: The SlideshowPro app requires you to first purchase a copy of
SlideshowPro from http://slideshowpro.net/  This app simply provides the
ability to embed SlideshowPro into pages with the Sitellite box chooser.

1. Unpack the app into inc/app

cp slideshowpro_app.tar.gz /path/to/sitellite/inc/app
cd /path/to/sitellite/inc/app
tar -zxf slideshowpro_app.tar.gz

2. Set the permissions of the pix folder to 777

chmod -R 777 slideshowpro/pix

3. Generate a slideshowpro.swf file through Flash as you normally would using
SlideshowPro.  In this step, you can customize the features of SlideshowPro
however you like.

4. Drop the generated slideshowpro.swf file into the slideshowpro/html folder.

4. Embed into any page with the box chooser or with the XT command:

<xt:box name="slideshowpro/embed" folder="some_folder_inside_pix" />

Make sure that "some_folder_inside_pix" is replaced with a real sub-folder
of pix/ that contains .jpg images.
