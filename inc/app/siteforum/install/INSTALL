0. Requirements:

SiteForum relies on the Org app, which is currently available via anonymous CVS
access from sitellite.org.  Additionally, for search capabilities, SiteForum
relies entirely on SiteSearch, which is used automatically if it is found
installed on your web site.  If not, your SiteForum will have no search
capabilities.

1. Create the necessary database tables with the following commands:

$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME < inc/app/siteforum/install/install-mysql.sql
(enter password when prompted)

2. Install siteforum_post collection into the CMS, enabling SiteSearch
to index your forum.

$ cp inc/app/siteforum/install/siteforum_post.php inc/app/cms/conf/collections/

3. You are now ready to load your new forum by linking to:
