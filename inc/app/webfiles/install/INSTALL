Usage:

Install into inc/app/webfiles folder.  Access via:

http://www.example.com/index/webfiles-app

Requires a valid Sitellite login.

Status:

Development has been halted, although it is very close to working.
WebDAV does not seem to be a stable solution for remote file access,
so we're focusing instead on the Sitellite Desktop and integrating
that with our own custom REST API for Web Files that supports all
of the same operations as WebDAV, but which we control at the API
and design level.  The Web Files REST API will also be easier to
support and extend with future ideas like versioning, whereas
the WebDAV versioning extension is ill-supported by the majority
of popular clients and servers.

Litmus tests:

- basic 15/15 passed
- copymove 13/13 passed
- props 22/30 passed (not officially supporting custom properties)
- locks 20/30 passed (they do seem to be working correctly via cadaver)
- http 4/4 passed

Clients:

Cadaver

- No known issues

Transmit

- No known issues

OSX

- "File already exists" error on PUT for any uppercase file names.
  Results in a zero-byte file uploaded.  In Web Files, names are
  changed to lowercase because MySQL select is case-insensitive
  and Web Files depends on that for versioning and other features.
- Stores dot-files outside of Web Files collection, just in the
  filesystem, so they don't pollute the file list for other users.

Windows

- Not thoroughly tested, but the only known issue is direct editing
  fails (edit through a program or right-click to open).  Download,
  drag 'n' drop, upload, etc. all work fine.
- Make sure to connect using dav@ to specify username or Windows will
  revert to an unsupported authentication scheme.  Still had to go
  through the username/password prompt 3 times before it took (same
  creds each time, *sigh*).

Webdrive (3rd party Windows client)

- No known issues

Misc:

- Not yet tested with https
- Copy/move folders only goes 2 levels, not recursive
