Installing Ysearch

1. Unpack the Ysearch download into your inc/app folder.  On Unix you would
use the following commands:

cp ysearch-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz /PATH/TO/SITELLITE/inc/app
tar -zxf ysearch-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz
mv ysearch-1.0.0-stable ysearch

2. Open the file inc/app/ysearch/conf/properties.php and enter the website
domain to be searched.  You can search up to 10 sites.  If you just have one
site to search, enter it in like the following example:

appconf_set ('site', 'www.example.com');

If you have multiple sites, you can specify them as an array like this:

appconf_set ('site', array ('www.site1.com', 'www.site2.com', 'www.site3.com'));

When you're done, save the properties.php file and close it.

3. Somewhere on your website, you will now need to link to the address
/index/ysearch-app  Alternately, you can use the box chooser in Sitellite
Professional Edition to embed Ysearch into an existing page.
