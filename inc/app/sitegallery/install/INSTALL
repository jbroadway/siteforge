ABOUT

SiteGallery lets you create photo galleries and slideshows in Sitellite.
SiteGallery uses Web Files or the Image Chooser for storage of the images
and is simply used for displaying the galleries.

INSTALLATION

To install SiteGallery, simply unzip it to a folder named inc/app/sitegallery
in your Sitellite installation and run the following command:

chmod -R 777 /path/to/sitellite/inc/app/sitegallery/pix/thumbnails

There is no additional setup required, as SiteGallery is just a wrapper around
the Web Files content collection in Sitellite.

The commands on Unix systems to unzip the file would be:

# Unzip the file
tar -zxf sitegallery-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz

# Rename the resulting folder
mv sitegallery-1.0.0-stable sitegallery

# Delete the downloaded file
rm sitegallery-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz

USAGE

To create a photo gallery, log into Sitellite and go to the Control
Panel.  From there, under the Content menu choose "Web Files", then click the
"Add File" link on the next screen.

Click "Browse..." and upload the first image file.  Next, click "Add" next
to the Folder field and create a new folder for your photo gallery files.
Make sure to select the new folder after creating it; it will appear in the
select box once it's been created.

To ensure that visitors will be able to access the files, click on the "State"
tab and set the status to "Approved".  Click "Create" at the bottom of the
form and repeat for any additional files you wish to add to your photo
gallery.  This is also how you will add new images to your gallery later on.

The next step is to link your photo gallery into your website.  The
easiest way to do this is to use the Xed 2 box chooser.  After installing
SiteGallery, Sitellite Pro users will see a new "SiteGallery" option in
that dialogue window.  Simply select "SiteGallery" from the list, then one of
the following:

- Gallery from Web Files
- Gallery from Image Chooser
- Slideshow from Image Chooser
- Protected Image
- Slideshow from Web Files

From here, fill out any information requested by the box you've selected, such
as the title and folder containing the images.  This will create a box that
will render your photo gallery or slideshow into the current page.

For users of Sitellite GPL Edition, there are 3 ways to call SiteGallery
without Xed 2's box chooser.  These are:

1. Linking directly to the podcast or playlist URLs

The link format to link directly to a gallery is:

http://www.example.com/index/sitegallery-pixgallery-action/path.foldername/title.Gallery Name

2. Making a sidebar box an alias of the sitegallery/pixgallery box

To do this, create a new sidebar and under the "Properties" tab enter the
following value into the "Alias" field:

sitegallery/pixgallery?title=Gallery Name&path=foldername

3. Linking to the photo gallery boxes in an XT template

The format of the XT box inclusion would look like this:

<xt:box name="sitegallery/pixgallery" title="Gallery Name" path="foldername" />

That should be all you have to do to get up and running with a new photo
gallery or slideshow for your website.

DEVELOPERS

For developers, you can also use the loader_box() function or the {box} tag
in .spt files to include SiteGallery capabilities into your custom web
applications.  For example:

<?php

echo loader_box (
	'sitegallery/pixgallery',
	array (
		'title' => 'Gallery Name',
		'path' => 'foldername',
	)
);

?>

And in an .spt file:

{box sitegallery/pixgallery?title=Gallery Name&path=foldername}
