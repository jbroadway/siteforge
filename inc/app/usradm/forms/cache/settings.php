Note: Page-level caching should only be used on pages that can't ever contain user-specific data.  If this rule is not kept, then data specific to one user could end up in the hands of another.  This means that page-level caching is not always the right choice in all circumstances."

It may be a directory name (ie. cache/pages), mod:proxy, which will generates the proper HTTP headers for a proxy/cache server to provide the caching, or bdb:path/to/page_store.db, which uses the Berkeley DB software to store the cached pages.  Note: Berkeley DB stores require PHP's DBA extension."
