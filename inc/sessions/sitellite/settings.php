;
; - Lines enclosed in square brackets ([]) denote new sections.
;
; - Lines with a keyword = value on them represent configuration options.
;
; - Option values that contain non-alphanumeric characters must be

;   another (ie. "<table border=\"0\"></table>") is unfortunately not
;   possible.
;
; - Do not remove or alter in any way the first and last lines of this
;   file.  They are in place for security reasons, and changing them will
;   compromise the security of your web site by potentially displaying

;
; Content requirements:
;
; - This file contains configuration information pertaining to our sessions.
;
; - Required sections are [Session], [Handler], [Source], and
;   [Store].  Required options are 'timeout', 'useclass', 'driver' (inside
;   the Handler, Source, and Store sections, and any options specific to
;   the chosen drivers (consult saf/docs for details).
;

[Session]

; Sometime session sources and handlers can set inactivity timeouts.
; This value specifies the timeout length in seconds.  Set it to 0 if
; you don't want sessions to time out on the server side, or to a
; large number (ie. 31536000 is 1 year) to not expire for a long time.
timeout			= 7200

; Although you're unlikely to ever need to, this allows you to specify
; an alternate directory for retrieving user privileges.
path			= inc/conf/auth

[Handler]

; Here are all of the values specific to the session handler.  The only
; required value is the driver, and all others are dependent on the
; specified driver.  See each driver's documentation for more information.

; This sets the session handler to use.  The session handler handles the
; interaction between the browser and the server.
driver			= Cookie

; The name to use for the session cookie.
cookiename 		= sitellite_session_id

; Sometime session sources and handlers can set inactivity timeouts.
; This value specifies the timeout length in seconds.  Set it to 0 if
; you don't want sessions to time out but to be erased when the user's
; browser is closed.  Set it to a large number (ie. 31536000 is 1 year)
; to not expire for a long time.
cookieexpires	= 7200
